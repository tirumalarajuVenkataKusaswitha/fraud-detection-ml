- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)
- Jupyter Notebook

##  Key Concepts
- Imbalanced Learning
- Feature Engineering
- Data Preprocessing
- Model Evaluation using Precision-Recall & ROC-AUC
- Classification Models

##  Workflow
1. Data Loading & Exploration  
2. Handling Class Imbalance  
3. Feature Engineering  
4. Model Training  
5. Performance Evaluation  

##  Evaluation Metrics
